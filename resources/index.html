    <p>"If we begin with the assumption that the visual system analyzes a spatial frequency in terms of the simple sum of the harmonics in it, the first step is to study the responses of the system to simple sine-wave gratings." <br />
    "Contrast and Spatial Frequency" <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/magazine/sa/1974/11-01/">Scientific American, November 1974</a></p>
    <p>In this essay, I hope to:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Praise the sine wave for its ability to make a claim seem correct.</li>
      <li>Find the best terminology and images for thinking of those areas currently described by "spatial frequency channels", "contrast", "sine wave grating".</li>
      <li>Run circles around previous coverage of this topic, using interactive images to explore and demonstrate.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Part 1 - throwing something at the wall</h2>
    <p>Here's a simple gradient.</p>
    <div id="1-twosides"></div>
    <script src="/js/app.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <p>Important reaction: when I look at the displayed row and ask myself if I can see the color change,
    my answer is, "I don't care!". It's too painful to decide. With a grating it'd be more fun, I think.</p>
    <p>Other reactions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The row indicator is really bad. It shouldn't constantly cover the image.</li>
      <li>Are these dull colors necessary?</li>
      <li>The slider should be labeled.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Part 2 - the sweep grating</h2>
    <div id="2-sweep-grating"></div>
    <hr />
    <p>Needs to be fun to look at! That might be the main reason to use a grating.</p>
    <p>Put something around the image so that it's clear where the row-probe works.</p>
