    <p>"If we begin with the assumption that the visual system analyzes a spatial frequency in terms of the simple sum of the harmonics in it, the first step is to study the responses of the system to simple sine-wave gratings." <br />
    "Contrast and Spatial Frequency" <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/magazine/sa/1974/11-01/">Scientific American, November 1974</a></p>
    <p>In this essay, I hope to:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Praise the sine wave for its ability to make a claim seem correct.</li>
      <li>Find the best terminology and images for thinking of those areas currently described by "spatial frequency channels", "contrast", "sine wave grating".</li>
      <li>Run circles around previous coverage of this topic, using interactive images to explore and demonstrate.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Part 1 - throwing something at the wall</h2>
    <p>Here's a simple gradient.</p>
    <div id="1-twosides"></div>
    <p>Important reaction: when I look at the displayed row and ask myself if I can see the color change,
    my answer is, "I don't care!". It's too painful to decide. With a grating it'd be more fun, I think.</p>
    <p>Other reactions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Are these dull colors necessary?</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h2>Part 2 - the sweep grating</h2>
    <div id="2-sweep-grating"></div>
    <ul>
      <li>Is the color exposer still the best tool for the job? Might need a stripe exposer instead / in addition.</li>
      <li>Keep going. Get another interpretation on the screen. Catch more big ideas.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h2>Part 3 - gratings with harmonics</h2>
    <div id="3-harmonic-grating"></div>
    <ul>
      <li>This input control is fun! Make sure the final product has this fun-ness.</li>
      <li>While exploring, I would have liked to be able to see my current eyedropper color in rgb(x,y,z) or #FFFFFF form. When tons of harmonics are included, I want to see if it's just oscillating between two colors.</li>
      <li>I recommend recommended presets.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <p>Put something around the image so that it's clear where the row-probe works.</p>
